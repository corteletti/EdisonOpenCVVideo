# EdisonOpenCVVideo
Recording a Video with Intel Edison and OpenCV

This script will record a video using a UVC webcam hooked up to Intel Edison

It relies on openCV and its python bindings. 

You can install OpenCV on Edison by first sourcing AlexT's amazing opkg repo:

http://alextgalileo.altervista.org/edison-package-repo-configuration-instructions.html

And then installing with 

$ opkg install python-opencv

Dependencies will be dragged in automatically.
